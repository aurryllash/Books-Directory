## Problem Statement

The most basic project I am using Node.js and Express.js is a simple REST API.

For this purpose, I’d like to suggest you build a book directory, where you would need to create endpoints, using the four most basic methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

I use GET for getting all books or getting only one book by id. With the POST method, add a new book to the list. I need the PUT method for updating the existing book, and it’s evident that with the DELETE method, remove the book from the list.

For this application, I am using mongoDB database..
